    <Accordion title="What is Print.App?">
        **Print.App** is a print customizer cloud software that empowers print companies to accept print orders with personalized designs.

        It allows you to convert your Print store into a DIY platform where your users can basically edit design templates using text, shape, images etc and submit to you for print.
        The system generates a print-ready PDF file of exactly what your customer creates using this tool on your website.
        
        So without any Photoshop skills, your users can create their Business Cards, Calendars, Photo Album, etc on your website without stress.

    <Accordion title="What do I need to set up my store?">
        On your end, you basically need the minimum requirements for each platform you want to install. 
        
        A bulk of the work is done on our servers. So you should check out software requirements for any of OpenCart, PrestaShop, WordPress or Shopify depending on which you prefer to use. For a minimum low traffic site, a shared hosting is just about enough.
        
        And if you have an existing store, then you need not bother.
