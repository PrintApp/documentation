### Previewing a Design as a Customer

You can create a preview link for your design to see how it looks like for your customers.

1.  Navigate to the [Design section](https://admin.print.app/designs) of the Admin Panel and locate your Design

2.  Click on the **More** button to open the drop down menu as shown below:
    <img width="280" class="rounded" src="/images/design-more.png" />

3.  Click on the **Create New Project URL** button as shown below:
    <img width="280" class="rounded" src="/images/design-gen-url.png" />

4.  You will see a side bar open with the new URL. Click it to open the project in a new tab.

5.  You can now see the design as a customer would see it.

6.  You can also share this link with your customers to create a new project. Just be sure to give each customer a unique link to avoid conflicts.
