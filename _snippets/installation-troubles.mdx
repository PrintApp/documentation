### Trouble shooting guide

If you can't see the Customize now button in your product page, please follow these guides:

1.  Ensure you have a price set for the product; if not, the customize button will not show.
2.  Also ensure that the domain name matches the domain title in [Print.App domains](https://admin.print.app/domains)
3.  If still it doesn't show, please reach out to us on our [discord community](https://discord.gg/XNdtdFxNdE).
