The Print.App Editor is a highly versatile piece of software developed and built to give customers, the best
experience possible.

In designing it, we thought through the average user's mind, asking what they will want to do and
what approach they will take at each step of the way. We then optimized it by implementing features we wished
to see in a capable graphics editor.
The end result is a beautiful, functional editor that is intuitive and very easy to use.

#Editor Sections

In full view, the editor has the following distint sections, which you can see highligthed in the image
further below:



1.  Sidebar - This houses all the resource and configuration panels. This is where you will find Graphics, Fonts, Design, Page and Item Configurations, Color panels, Customer photo uploads and a Help panel with more configuration options.

2.  Top Menubar - On the top right hand corner of the screen sits the Preview button in a distinct action color. And to the left of that, customers can execute other primary actions like download projects, share and save for later.
The top Menubar also houses the item-related actions menus like alignments, depth management, adding new items like Texts, Shapes, Calendars etc.

3.  Navigation - The Navigation below the stage allows users to manage pages. Pages can be created, dragged to sort or removed from the navigation section. It also houses the Zoom tool and the Layers menu. This panel can be minimized to create more space in the design stage.

4.  Stage - The Stage is the Canvas, where the action happens. This is where customers interact with design pages. Depending on the context, a Float panel is also housed in the stage for actions like changing a product color, Canvas size adjustment, Datasource selection etc. We will discuss more on the stage interaction in a later section.
