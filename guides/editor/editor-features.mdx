### Sidebar
This houses all the resource and configuration panels. This is where you will find Graphics, Fonts, Design, Page and Item Configurations, Color panels, Customer photo uploads and a Help panel with more configuration options.

<Note>
    The Sidebar can be positioned on either the **Left** or **Right** hand side of the editor. The default position is left and you can change this in the settings section of your [Print.App Admin](https://admin.print.app/settings).

The top Menubar also houses the Object-related actions menus like Object Alignments, Depth management, adding new items like Texts, Shapes, Calendars etc.


### Navigation
The Navigation under the stage is used to manage pages. Here, pages can be created, dragged to sort or removed. It also houses the Zoom tool and the Layers menu. This panel can be minimized to create more space in the design stage.
