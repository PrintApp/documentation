title: Banners & Large Prints
description: "From roll‑up banners to signage and posters—size correctly, guide content, and export sharp results."

Large format is about clarity at distance and durability up close. Help customers focus on essentials while your templates handle sizing, bleed, and finishing.

## Typical products

- Roll‑up banners, hanging banners
- Posters and window graphics
- Backdrops and step‑and‑repeat walls
- Yard signs and rigid boards (foam, PVC, ACM)

## Building blocks

- Clearly marked safe areas, bleed, and finishing zones (grommets, pole pockets)
- Big‑type Smart Texts for headlines; minimal body copy
- High‑contrast color palettes for visibility
- Image placeholders constrained to aspect ratios that won’t crop faces awkwardly

## Patterns that work

### Single‑panel banners

- Set exact banner size in the Design; include grommet marks/pole pocket overlays as locked guides
- Use very large headline type; keep body copy short
- For event banners, provide a date/location Smart Text that’s easy to update

### Multi‑panel or sectional graphics

- Use separate pages for each panel; name pages “Panel 1”, “Panel 2”, etc.
- For flexible ordering, combine with <a href="/guides/designs/modules/page-selector">Page Selector</a> so customers can add/remove sections
- Provide alignment marks across panels so seams align in print

### Posters and rigid signs

- Offer aspect‑specific Designs (A‑series vs US sizes)
- Keep images at appropriate resolution; large prints can be sharp at lower PPI if viewed from distance, but avoid blocky artifacts
- Include optional QR Codes only if scanning distance makes sense

## Image and type guidance

- Headline sizes should be legible from intended viewing distance (e.g., 10–20 ft)
- Prefer vector logos; raster images should meet minimum effective PPI at final size
- Use high‑contrast text/background combinations

## Finishing and install notes

- Show grommet locations, hems, or pole pockets as locked template layers
- Keep critical content away from edges and hardware zones
- For double‑sided prints, build front/back pages and check mirroring as required
