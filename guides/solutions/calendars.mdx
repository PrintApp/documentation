Create wall, desk, or poster calendars your customers can personalize and submit as print‑ready PDFs. This guide shows the end‑to‑end flow using the built‑in Calendar module.

<Tip>
If you're new to the Calendar feature, start with the module basics here: <a href="/guides/designs/modules/calendar">Calendar Module</a>
</Tip>

## When to use this

- 12‑month wall calendars (cover + monthly pages)
- Year‑at‑a‑glance poster calendars (all months on one page)
- Photo calendars (monthly grid + user photo area)
- Desk tent calendars or mini calendars (compact layouts)

## Prerequisites

- A Print.App account with access to your <a href="https://admin.print.app/designs">Admin Designs</a>
- At least one store installation set up (see <a href="/installation">Installation</a>)
- Basic familiarity with adding text/images to a Design

## 1) Create a Calendar Design

1. In your <a href="https://admin.print.app/designs">Admin Designs</a>, create a new Design for your product size (e.g., A3, Letter, 12×12 in).
2. Add a Cover page (optional) and a Month page template you’ll duplicate.
3. Set bleed/margins as needed. You can also review global Designer lines and snapping under <a href="/configuration/settings">Settings</a> → Designer Settings.

## 2) Enable the Calendar module

1. Open the Design in the editor.
2. In the left Design panel, click <strong>Add Module</strong> → <strong>Calendar</strong>.

3. Configure defaults such as Year, Week/Day labels, Cell gap and typography.

<Note>
The Calendar module generates Month objects you can style like other elements. You can create one or many month grids and position them anywhere on your page(s).
</Note>

## 3) Add and lay out months

Once the module is enabled, a Calendar button appears in the top menubar.

- Click the button to insert a Month onto the canvas.

	</Frame>

- For monthly pages: add one Month per page and position it under your artwork/photo area.
- For a yearly poster: add twelve Months to a single page and arrange them in a 3×4 grid (or your preferred layout).

To change a month, select the Month object and update its date from the context menu.

</Frame>

### Styling tips

- Use your brand fonts/colors for month names and day labels.
- Adjust cell gap and line weights for print clarity at your chosen size.
- Add holidays or special dates as separate small text objects or icons overlaying specific cells.

## 4) Add personalization areas

- Add an Image placeholder or a framed area above/beside the month grid for customer photos.
- Include optional caption Texts (e.g., “January Caption”), which customers can edit.
- Consider a cover page with a large photo area and a title Smart Text.

<Tip>
For large photo‑driven calendars, you can also explore the <a href="/guides/designs/modules/photos-module">Photo Print Module</a> to pre‑define photo sets your customers can drop images into. Keep the Calendar grid on each page and reserve a region for the photo set.
</Tip>

## 5) Prepare sizes, variants and finishing

- Create separate Designs for each size/aspect ratio you’ll sell (e.g., A3 vs Letter). Keep the month grid readable at print DPI.
- Add drill/punch marks, wire‑bind margins or clear safe areas in your template as needed.
- If you offer different start months (e.g., academic calendars), duplicate the Design and change the arranged sequence of months accordingly.

## 6) Assign to a product and test

1. Save your Design.
2. Assign it to a product on your platform (via your platform plugin) or integrate via <a href="/api-reference/editor/installation">Custom Installation</a>.
3. Open the product on your storefront and launch the Designer as a customer.
4. Personalize: upload images, edit captions, review each month page.
5. Save/Submit and verify the generated previews.

<Note>
PDF output contains your final page sequence (cover + months). Ensure every page includes the correct month grid and any bleed/trim marks you require.
</Note>

## Quality checklist

- Month grids display the correct year and month names across all pages
- Day labels and week starts match your locale/style
- Photo/caption areas don’t overlap the grid at small screens
- Lines, cell gaps and type sizes remain legible at print size
- Bleed/margins are set, and punch/bind areas are clear of critical content

## Troubleshooting

- Can’t see the Calendar button? Confirm the Calendar module is added to the Design.
- Month shows wrong year? Select the Month object and update the date in its context menu; also review the module’s Year default.
- Customize button missing on your product page? See <a href="/installation">Installation</a> and the troubleshooting note in that guide.
