To achive this, you simply need to create a Resource Profile to group select resources like Fonts, Colors, Graphics etc and assign that Profile to your Design Templates


### Create a Resource Profile

Navigate to the [Designs Page in Print.App Admin](https://admin.print.app/designs) and click the More Icon -> and click the Resource Profile button.

<img width="280" class="rounded-md" src="/images/profiles-btn.png" />

This loads up your Profiles, if any. Next, click the red Create New Profile button to create a new resource profile.

In the new window, give your profile a title and add the resources you want to include or exclude.

Including a resource means that only the resources you've selected will be available for use in the Design Template. Excluding a resource means that all resources will be available for use in the Design Template except the ones you've selected.

Save your Profile and close the resource profiles panel.


### Assign your Profile to a Design Template

Still within the Designs page, click the Configuration button against a Design you want to assign the profile to.
<img width="200" class="rounded-md" src="/images/design-config.png" />


In the new window, select the Resource Profiles tab.

click the plus button and select the profile you created earlier to assign it to this Design.

<Frame>
    <img class="rounded-md" src="/images/profile-assign.png" />
</Frame>

Save and close the window. Your Design Template now has the resources you've assigned to it.
