title: What is a Print.App Design?
description: "All about designs, types and the various features of a design"
---

A Print.App Design is a basic template file with pages containing a combination of Text and Graphics that customers can easily modify with little effort to suit their taste before adding to cart.

Designs can also be blank canvas pages giving customers the space to craft their own printable artwork.

For example, a simple Business Card Design can have a page with a background, Text elements for Name, Email, Phone Number and graphics to display a Brand Logo. Any of your customers can pick that up and input their details to create a new design for order.

<Tip>When a Design has been customized by a customer, the end result is a [Project](https://admin.print.app/projects), which you can render into a PDF, Print and deliver to said customer.</Tip>

### Anatomy of a Design

Fundamentally, there are four default layers in any Print.App Design and these are: `Underlay`, `Background`, `Canvas` and `Overlay` in that order from the bottom to top as shown in the picture below.

</Frame>

#### Underlay
The Underlay is the lowest layer _(pink in the picture above)_ and is reserved as a place to position template image of a physical product like a T-Shirt, a Mug, a Cap, Scarf etc. In most plain designs, you don't necessarily use this layer.

The T-Shirt or Scarf does not get printed in the final PDF file because you don't need the T-Shirt picture to print on the actual T-Shirt, only your customer's artwork is needed.

<Tip>You can use an **Underlay** to drive a design variation, so you can offer your customers the option to order Tshirts in Blue, Red, Purple or any color you stock.</Tip>

#### Background
The background layer is the next above Underlay and below the Canvas layer. This is the background layer your customers are able to directly edit and can be a Color, Transparent or a Graphics.

<Note>If you set an Underlay, don't forget to make your background partly or fully transparent, else it will cover the design area and obscure out the Underlay</Note>

#### Canvas
This is the canvas your customer gets to interact with and place objects like Shapes, Texts and Pictures. All design types make use of the Canvas.

When a user clicks to select items, they click on this canvas, not the Background or Underlay beneath.
The canvas is always clipped to a rectangle of your set dimension and you can also define a special shape to use as a Canvas clip to create a uniquely shaped Canvas.

You can set `Bleed`, `Trim`, `Margin` and `Fold` lines on a Canvas.

<Tip>You can use the **Canvas Size** to drive a design variation, to offer customers ability to pick a Canvas size or set a custom size when ordering. This can be useful for large print products like Banners, Signs and Billboards</Tip>

#### Overlay
The Overlay is the topmost layer and can contain a Graphics or Image object. Being the topmost layer, it only accepts Objects that have transparency, as you will want your customers to see a portion of what is beneath on other layers.

This layer can be printed or not depending by toggling the Print Foreground switch.

Overlays are useful for creating products like Mouse-pad, Phone covers, Laptop cases, Picture Frames etc., where you want customers to create designs underneath certain emblems and clipped out.

Below are sample products that can be created  with a combination of the different layers.

    <Tab title="Tshirts">
        We use the Underlay to display the Tshirt image and the Canvas as the design area

    <Tab title="Business Card">
        The Background is used to to show a fixed Graphics object while we add user Text and Logo Graphics to the canvas

    <Tab title="Mousepad">
        A transparent PNG image is used as the Overlay while customers design on the Canvas underneath
