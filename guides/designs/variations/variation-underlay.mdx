A Design variation is a single design with additional variations. Here, we are considering one with different Underlay colors.

<Tip>This is useful for products like TShirt. So we can have a base TShirt with variations in Orange, Red, Green etc.</Tip>

### Create a TShirt Design
Firstly, we need to create a TShirt Design or import one: [How to create designs](/guides/designs/create-a-design)

### Create an Underlay Variation
-   Load the Design to Edit and in the Editor, click the Designs tab
    
-   Click the Enable Variation button and select the Underlay Variation option
    <img width="320" src="/images/underlay-variation.png" />

-   This should display a Design Variation form where you can add a title that will be displayed to your customers.

-   The option `Tint original image` makes the editor tint the Design Underlay image to whatever color option you provide.

<Note>
    For the `Tint original image` to work properly, your Original Underlay images need to be a neutral color like white, with grey shades.
</Note>

-   Proceed to add as many colors as your product offers.
    <img width="320" src="/images/underlay-variation-form.png" />

-   You should see a Floating panel on the top right hand corner of the canvas with your preset colors. This is where your customers will be able to change the TShirt color
    <img width="240" src="/images/underlay-variation-float.png" />

-   If the Tint option is turned off, you will need to upload Underlay images for each color variants and for each page. Eg. Front and Back of a TShirt.

-   Save your Design and assign it to a product and test as a customer on your web store.
