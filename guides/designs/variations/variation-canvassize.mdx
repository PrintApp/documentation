A Design variation is a single design with additional variations. We can create Design Variants based on multiple canvas sizes

<Tip>This is essential for products like Banners so customers can select from different sizes or even create their own unique dimension</Tip>

### Create a Canvas Size Variation

-   To get started, load a Design or open one for edit from your [Admin Designs page](https://admin.print.app/designs)

-   Click the Design tab on the left panel and then click the Enable Design Variation button to select the Canvas Size Variation and Enable it
    <img width="320" src="/images/size-variation.png" />

-   A form should appear where you can provide the variation details and add your size variants:
    <img width="320" src="/images/size-variation-form.png" />
    -   `Allow Custom Values`: Enabling this allows customers to create their own unique size dimension
    -   `Load from selector`: This allows the Editor to load values from your product page.
    -   `Apply to all pages`: This will apply the dimension to all pages and not just the current one
    -   `Calculate with area` Enabling this option propagates the `width x height` area as a single value to your product page price calculator

-   The Variation element selector is used to instruct the editor which element in your product page has the sizes and is only displayed if you have enabled the `load from selector` option.

-   Save your Design and assign it to a product and test as a customer on your web store.
