### How to create a Clipping Mask

<Steps>
    <Step title="Add a Shape">
        First, add a shape to the canvas. You can add a circle, square, or any other shape from our Simple Shapes library.

        <img width="320" src="/images/add-shapes.png" alt="Add a Shape" />

        Alternatively, you can upload you own unique shape by clicking on the Upload button in Graphics tab.
        <br/>_It has to be to be a simple shape with single continous path._
        
    </Step>
    <Step title="Select your Shape and Enable Clipping Mask">
        Click on the shape to select it, then enable the `Set as Clipping Mask` option from the Object tab on the left side of the Editor.
        <br/>If you don't see this option, it's most likely your Shape is not a simple shape or it has multiple paths.

        <img width="320" src="/images/enable-clipping-mask.png" alt="Enable Clipping Mask" />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Upload an Image">
        Now, click on either the button or the thumbnail image on the Shape to upload an image into the Clipping Shape.
        <img width="320" src="/images/thumb-clipping-mask.png" alt="Upload an Image" />
        The image will be clipped and positioned inside the shape.
        Once you have the image inside the shape, you can use the context Button labelled **Select Group** to toggle between selecting the whole group and selecting the image only. And you can drag to position or scale them.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Fit Photo inside Frame">
        If you want the image to be resized to fit inside the Clipping Mask, enable the `Fit Photo inside Frame` option from the Object tab.
        <br/>This will resize the image to fit inside the shape.
    </Step>
