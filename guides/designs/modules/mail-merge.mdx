Mail Merge lets your customers create a batch of print pages that are personalized for each person.
For example, a company can personalize a single business card with each staff's details and submit it as a single project.

On your end, you get to download a single PDF file with each page showing the same design but with different staff details.

Mail Merge has two modes:
1.  **CSV Upload** - The data records is driven by a CSV or Excel sheet uploaded by your customer
2.  **Range Mode** - Records are generated by your customer specifying a number range with a starting value
    <br/>This is useful for generating products like Marathon Bib numbers.


### How to create Mail Merge Designs
-   To get started, load a Design or open one for edit from your [Admin Designs page](https://admin.print.app/designs)

-   Click the Design tab on the left panel and then click the `Add Module` button and click Mail Merge from the list.

-   All you have to do is select the mode and add the Text placeholders to your designs. The Text placeholders are described below


### Range Mode Text Placeholders
The Range Mode generates records using numbers. It presents your customers option to set a starting number and quantity.

To create a placeholder, just add a text with double hash. Anywhere the double hash is encountered, the index number will be inserted.

Eg: `00-##`. The number 234 will replace the ## and render: `00-234`

### CSV Upload Mode Text Placeholders
The CSV Upload mode uses the same template a Datasource does.
You basically create a Smart Text with a title. The title corresponds to a column name in the CSV file.

For example a Text titled `email` will have its content replaced with the corresponding email address value in the CSV record for that row
