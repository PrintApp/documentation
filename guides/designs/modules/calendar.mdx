---

The Calendar module is used to generate and style Calendar months automatically.

You can generate all Months of the year and place them on a page as desired to create any calendar design of your taste.

-   To get started, load a Design or open one for edit from your [Admin Designs page](https://admin.print.app/designs)

-   Next, we need to enable the Calendar Module so we can configure the year and some other styling.
    
    Click the Design tab on the left panel and then click the `Add Module` button and click Calendar from the list.

-   You should see the Calendar configuration form as shown below:

-   Once you've added a Calendar module, the Button to add a Calendar Month appears on the Top Menubar as shown in the      picture below. Anytime you need to create a Month, click that button and a Month will be added to your Canvas as shown.
