### How to enable a Photo Print module

-   To get started, load a Design or open one for edit from your [Admin Designs page](https://admin.print.app/designs)

-   Create a Template Page. This page will be duplicated as a set for customers to drag and add their photos or artwork.


    **For Photo sets, this will be your usuall 5 x 7, 8 x 10, etc.**
    **For Artwork prints, this could be A4, A3, etc.**

    You can create as many pages as required. They will be treated as a set.

    On your page configuration, you can enable the option to **"Place Graphics to Fit Page"**, so that dragged Photos can enlarge to fit in the page.
    You will find this option by expanding the **Advanced settings**
