    -   Cap the maximum number of pages by providing a limit number or leave blank for as many as the customer wishes to add.
    -   Enabling Page Swap means the customer can swap pages
    -   Start Blank will delete the current Design's starting page and allow the customer to start by adding a page
    -   You can use the current Design as page source or select an external Source Design from where the pages will be fetched.
    -   If you select the current Design as the pages source, `Required pages` is used to filter the pages that are loaded into the design by default, while the rest are available for the customer to add as they go along.

-   Save your Design and assign it to a product and test as a customer on your web store.
