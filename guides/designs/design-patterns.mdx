In the PrintApp editor, you can convert an Image or a Shape object into a repeating Pattern on the horizontal and vertical plane. You can also control the gap between the repeating objects as well as rotate and zoom them in place.

## How to create a Pattern

-   To get started, load a Design or open one for edit from your [Admin Designs page](https://admin.print.app/designs)

-   With your design opened, add any object from the Graphics panel unto the canvas and select it. You should find the pattern icon in the context menu as shown below:
    <img width="320" src="/images/pattern.png" />
    Click the **Make Pattern** button to create a new Pattern Object.

-   A new Pattern object will be created using the original element. You can edit the Pattern by clicking the **Edit Pattern** button as shown below:
    <img width="520" src="/images/edit-pattern.png" />
    You can edit the Horizontal or Vertical spacing, Zoom and Rotation.

-   The Pattern is treated as any other PrintApp Object, configurable using the Objects panel. You can lock, scale and transform it as you deem fit.

-   The PDF engine uses the source element to render each individual Pattern item so they appear exactly as the source element.
