Smart Objects are items on the canvas whose value is dynamically linked to a Form or a Datasource.

<Tip title="Editor showing the Form on the left panel">
    Forms are automatically displayed in the Editor to your customers if you have one or more Smart Texts enabled.

### How to create a Smart Text

-   Create a Text Object and edit the text value to what you want. eg `hello@company.com`
-   Select the Text and go to the Object tabs. Enable the Smart Text switch.
    <img width="300" src="images/smart-text-switch.png" />
    Your Text has become a Smart Object and will appear in a Form on the left panel when your customers are editing the Design.
-   To provide additional details, you can give the Text a title `Email`. You do this on the Object panel as well.


### Create a Smart Text using multiple variables

The simple Smart text you created earlier allowed you to create only one editable variable, which is an email.

Using curly braces `{variable}`, you can combine one or more variables into a single multi line Text field.
Think of an Address or user details. It has the a name, email, phone number with extension and address. These can be combined in a single text field but editable individually in the form.

```Text
{Name:Jane Doe}
{Email}
{!*Phone:: 081444 2822}  {*Ext:: 02}
{Address:Address line
Address Line 2,
City, Zip Code}
```
Consider the above as the full text you typed into a mutlti line textbox.
<br/>This is how it will appear in the form:
<img width="340" src="/images/smart-text-multi.png" />

Let us dissect the values by following each sets of curly braces *(opening and closing)*.

-   `{Name:Jane Doe}`: The first item before a colon `:` is teated as the title while the text that follows is treated as the default value. Here, the title is Name, and the default value is Jane Doe.

-   `{Email}`: This is treated as the Title with no default text value.

-   `{!*Phone:: 081444 2822}  {*Ext:: 02}`:
    -   The `!` means that line is required and must be supplied by the customer.
    -   The `*` before a Title implies that though the `Phone` and `Ext` are titles, they should be included in the final text content, so they have dual use. A title, and as part of the final text on canvas.
    -   The double colon `::` implies that the first colon is a separator while the second one should be included in the final text value. So you have `Phone: 081444 2822 Ext: 02` as the final text; replacing the numbers with whatever your customer provides.

-   The Address line spans 3 rows and should be treated as a single Title, Value pair. With this, a multi line textbox is provided for the user to type into. If they omit line 2 of the address, the text shifts up.
