### Texts

Print.App has two basic Text types:
1. **Expandable Text** - stretches the container as you type
2. **Wrap Text** - does not stretch the container but wraps to the next line when the text reaches the end of the container

At the click of a button, you can toggle between these types. Texts can also be anchored to the top, middle, or bottom of the canvas to direct the flow of additional text lines.

<img width="400" class="rounded-md" src="/images/typography.png" />

It also features a variety of styles to choose from, including:
- **Curve** - text follows a curve which can also be reversed
- **Bulge** - text bulges outwards or inwards
- **Perspective** - the text gradually shrinks or expands from one side to the other

<Tip>
    With Smart Objects, you can make your text editable in a Form or even drive certain aspect of your text value from a data source or CSV file.

### Fonts

By default, your domain has access to a collection of fonts and you can also upload your own custom fonts.

<Frame>
    <img class="rounded-md" src="/images/fonts.png" />
</Frame>

You can upload all standard font weights and styles from Thin to Black, Regular to Italic, and everything in between.

#### Font Types

The following types of fonts can be uploaded:

<Tip>
    You can create a Resource Profile to assign certain fonts to a Design Template. This way, only the fonts you've selected will be available for use in that Design Template.
