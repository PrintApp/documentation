### About Webhooks

The Webhooks enables you to easily integrate and connect the Print.App platform to your outside platforms. For instance, you may want to send the PDF file of a project directly to your printer, or save all your user's uploaded pictures in your DropBox or Google Drive.

A Webhook makes this possible by invoking your specified external URL whenever an even happens on the Print.App platform along with the details of such an event for further actions.

At the moment, we can notify you when:

-  **A new project is created, i.e when your customer completes a design.**
-  **A file is uploaded by your customer.**

You can utilize the new-project Webhook to send the completed PDF/JPEG/PNG files to your print service provider.


### Setting up a Webhook

To get started, navigate to the [settings page in your Print.App admin](https://admin.print.app/settings)
and click the Webhooks tab.

We need a service URL to send that notification to, for that service to get the file and save in a Google Drive.

For this, we can use [Zapier](https://zapier.com), a service that connects different apps and services together. We will create a Zap that listens to the Webhook notification and saves the file in your Google Drive.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Start">
        Register or login to Zapier and click the Make a Zap button on the top left hand corner.
        A Zap is simply a workflow link you create between apps on Zapier.
